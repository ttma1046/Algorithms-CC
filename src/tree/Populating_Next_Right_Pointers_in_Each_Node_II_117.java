Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Follow up:

You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 6000.
-100 <= node.val <= 100

    Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(N) since we process each node exactly once. 
    Note that processing a node in this context means popping the node from the queue and then establishing the next pointers.

    Space Complexity: O(N). 
    This is a perfect binary tree which means the last level contains N/2 nodes. 
    The space complexity for breadth first traversal 
    is the maximum space occupied and the space occupied by the queue is dependent upon the maximum number of nodes in particular level. 
    So, in this case, the space complexity would be O(N).
