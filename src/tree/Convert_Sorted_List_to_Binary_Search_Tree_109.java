Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:

Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.

Example 2:

Input: head = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105

    Time Complexity: O(NlogN).

    Suppose our linked list consists of N elements.

    For every list we pass to our recursive function, we have to calculate the middle element for that list.

    For a list of size N, it takes N / 2 steps to find the middle element

    i.e. O(N) to find the mid.

    We do this for every half of the original linked list. From the looks of it, this seems to be an O(N^2) algorithm.

    However, on closer analysis, it turns out to be a bit more efficient than O(N^2).

    Let's look at the number of operations that we have to perform on each of the halves of the linked list.

    As we mentioned earlier, it takes N/2 steps to find the middle of a linked list with N elements.

    After finding the middle element, we are left with two halves of size N / 2 each.

    Then, we find the middle element for both of these halves and it would take a total of 2 Ã— N / 4 steps for that.

    And similarly for the smaller sublists that keep forming recursively. This would give us the following series of operations for a list of size N.

    (N / 2) + 2 * (N / 4) + 4 * (N / 8) + 8 * (N / 16)

    Essentially, this is done log N times since we split the linked list in half every time.

    Hence, the above equation becomes:

    O (N log N)

    Space Complexity: O(log N).

    Since we are resorting to recursion,

    there is always the added space complexity of the recursion stack that comes into picture.

    This could have been O(N) for a skewed tree, but the question clearly states that we need to maintain the height balanced property.

    This ensures the height of the tree to be bounded by O(logN). Hence, the space complexity is O(logN).

    Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: The time complexity comes down to just O(N) now since we convert the linked list to an array initially and then we convert the array into a BST.
    Accessing the middle element now takes O(1) time and hence the time complexity comes down.

    Space Complexity: Since we used extra space to bring down the time complexity, the space complexity now goes up to O(N) as opposed to just O(logN) in the previous solution.
    This is due to the array we construct initially.
