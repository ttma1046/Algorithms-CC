Problem:
This problem is a variant of closest pair sum. 
You'll be given two arrays:
arr1 = { {1, 2000}, {2, 3000}, {3, 4000} }
arr2 = { { 1, 5000 }, {2, 3000} }
the first element of every pair represents id and the second value represents the value.
and a target x = 5000
Find the pairs from both the arrays whose vaue add upto a sum which is less than given target and should be close to the target.

Output for the above example:
{ {1, 2} } // Note that the output should be in id's
